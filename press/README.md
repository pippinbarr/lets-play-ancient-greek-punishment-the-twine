In _The Twine_ the punishments are presented as hypertext fiction using the much-loved story-making software [Twine](http://www.twinery.org/).

## History

_The Twine_ is part of my ongoing idea of essentially spending 2019 making variations on the base _Ancient Greek Punishment_ set of minigames as a way to remain "productive" while in transition to a life with a new baby.

This game has involved engaging with (my perception of) the typical uses of Twine as a story-telling platform and thinking about how to fit my repeated retellings of the punishment myths into this format in an appropriate way. As is usually the case, I've been particularly interested to leverage the various technical aspects available in Twine (cycling links, linked passages, text-modifiers) in order to convey the eternal spirit of the individual punishments in a medium-specific way.

_Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: The Twine_ is also another data-point in the ultra-detailed process documentation approach called [MDMA](http://www.gamesasresearch.com/mdma). So, if you want to, you can read a lot about the game's development by reading its [process documentation](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-the-twine/blob/master/process/README.md), by going through its [commit history](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-the-twine/commits/master), and by reading the [research questions](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-the-twine/blob/master/process/research-questions.md).

## Technology

_Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: The Twine_ was created in [Twine](http://www.twinery.org), a one-stop shop for building simple (or quite complicated) stories for play in the browser, largely based around passages of text connected by hyperlinks.
