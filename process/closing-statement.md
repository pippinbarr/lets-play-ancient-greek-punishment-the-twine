# XYZ

Structure?
- There's not much in way of commits to bother with
- Showing code might be nice here (at least to convey complexity)
- Obviously showing graph structures can be nice
- Maybe identify thematic areas of interest and then expand on a per-game basis in this case? I think it's a simple structure that might work (in chess edition I did this but with cute thematising headers which I think can probably work here...? Especially if each game is maybe more emblematic than others? Tried to identify below with asterisks)

Possible themes
- Agency
- Affordances (studying the list of macros)
- Physicality
- Mappings
- Writing style and pithiness
- A "typical twine"
- Cycles and infinite accumulations

Per game
- Sisyphus
  - Click as push
  - Click as effort
  - Cycling link as emblematic of Twine*
  -

- Tantalus
  - Mouse/finger movement as reaching, clicking as grasping*
  - Subtractive agency???
  - Failed actions in Twine
  - "Truth" of action? Action in the action or action in the text?
  -

- Prometheus
  - Inaction, no agency*
  - No struggle
  - Inevitability
  - Being done to
  - Time cycle
  -

- Danaids
  - Classic hypertext cycle (structure from Bernstein)*
  - Clicks as individual acts, typical form
  - Very dissociated from the actual physical acts of the story
  -

- Zeno
  - Additive infinity*
  - Most complex code underlying it
  - Still premised on a specific macro, but significantly more fiddly
  - (Maybe it's worth showing the code for each?)
  - Novel solution to Zeno (additive rather than cyclical) - because I couldn't use the cycle structure again in good faith
