Well, I went straight for PROMETHEUS. Again I don’t think this is my best area…. all I could see was a series of descriptions that came up one after the other (Mac - Firefox). I have attached most of them. I couldn’t find anything to click or anyway to write anything. I really think you need someone at a slightly higher level to do the text based stuff testing….unless the gag was that you were tied down and couldn’t do anything. In that case it IS BRILLIANT!

I didn’t feel I was playing in this form. Although I loved Tantalus the most. And Zeno the second most.

In Tantalus the act and the text are so in sync I just flipped back and forth a few times for fun. And for Zeno I of course tried to get a few lines of halving.

I didn’t get the same sense of cause and effect with the others but as I am not sure you are even interested in that I just followed by own inclinations.

Sisphus seemed a bit bleak with so many steps (effort) wrapped up in two lines even though the words change.

Prometheus - going at it again I liked the lack of highlighted colour. O that’s weird, I thought I was making the text change by clicking, but no!

And then with the Daneids I get not just colour but … the first person. In such a minimal world that felt very surprising.

I got back to the menu each time by refreshing the browser.

And I wondered whether the name of each game should not be on its page - I know it’s minimal but could feel orienting or something about working through the list.

A mysterious enterprise!
